# Command line C++ Typing Test

This is a simple command line application to facilitate the memorization of the (ever growing) list C++ keywords. [^1] The intent is to stimulate kinesthetic learning by typing for speed. Upon running it, you'll be prompted with a key word, which you must type in accurately in order to advance to the next. After completing of all the keywords  you're presented with your speed measured in WPM, and given the option to save the time to a leaderboard stored locally.

[^1]: Current through C++20.


To compile:
```
make main
```
To run:
```
./main
```
