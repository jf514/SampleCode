# Kinematic Multi-trailer Demo
This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic multi-trailer model from simple kinematic principles. [^1] It's meant to show what that model looks like, as well as one of the key insights: if you've solved the single trailer problem, then it's easy to organize your code such that you can also solve the multi-trailer problem.

To maximally enjoy the model:

1) Steer by mouse on desktop, or touch on mobile.
2) Add remove trailers using the buttons at the top.

Have fun!
